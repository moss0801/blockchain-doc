#   SECTION: Capabilities
#
#   - This section defines the capabilities of fabric network. This is a new
#   concept as of v1.1.0 and should not be utilized in mixed networks with
#   v1.0.x peers and orderers.  Capabilities define features which must be
#   present in a fabric binary for that binary to safely participate in the
#   fabric network.  For instance, if a new MSP type is added, newer binaries
#   might recognize and validate the signatures from this type, while older
#   binaries without this support would be unable to validate those
#   transactions.  This could lead to different versions of the fabric binaries
#   having different world states.  Instead, defining a capability for a channel
#   informs those binaries without this capability that they must cease
#   processing transactions until they have been upgraded.  For v1.0.x if any
#   capabilities are defined (including a map with all capabilities turned off)
#   then the v1.0.x peer will deliberately crash.

### 채널 genesis block 생성

configtxgen tool을 이용해서 ./configtx/configtx.yaml($FABRIC_CFG_PATH/configtx.yaml) 파일의 'MossApplicationGenesis' profile에 대한 채널의 genesis blcok을 ./channel-artifacts/mosschannel.blcok 에 생성합니다.

configtxgen 실행 전에 FABRIC_CFG_PATH가 confgixtx.yaml 경로로 설정되어야 합니다.

여기서는 채널명을 'mosschannel'로 생성합니다.

편의를 위해서 채널명을 환경변수로 설정합니다.
```
export CHANNEL_NAME=mosschannel
```

====
*Configuration* +
The configtxgen tool’s output is largely controlled by the content of configtx.yaml. This file is searched for at FABRIC_CFG_PATH and must be present for configtxgen to operate.

Refer to the sample configtx.yaml shipped with Fabric for all possible configuration options. You may find this file in the config directory of the release artifacts tar, or you may find it under the sampleconfig folder if you are building from source.
====

```
cd "$FABRIC_NETWORK_HOME"

export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=${PWD}/configtx
mkdir -p channel-artifacts
configtxgen -profile MossApplicationGenesis -outputBlock ./channel-artifacts/${CHANNEL_NAME}.block -channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME}
```

```

### FABRIC_CFG_PATH 재설정 및 BLOCKFILE 설정
편의를 취해서 채널이름을 환경변수로 설정합니다.


genesis block 생성을 위해서 지정한 FABRIC_CFG_PATH 경로를 config 로 변경합니다. (변경된 경로는 Orderer의 채널 생성 및 참여(join)시 사용됩니다.)

편의를 위해 생성된 genesis block 파일 경로를 $BLOCKFILE 환경변수로 지정합니다.

```
cd "$FABRIC_NETWORK_HOME"

export FABRIC_CFG_PATH=${PWD}/config
export BLOCKFILE=${PWD}/channel-artifacts/${CHANNEL_NAME}.block
```

### 채널생성

link:https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.4/commands/osnadminchannel.html[osnadmin channel]

osnadmin을 이용해서 채널을 생성하고, osn(Ordering Service Node)를 채널에 참여(join)시킵니다. 이 때 orderer 설정은 '${FABRIC_CFG_PATH}/orderer.yaml'이 사용됩니다. 여기서는 config/orderer.yaml 파일이 사용됩니다.

====
The *osnadmin channel* command allows administrators to perform channel-related operations on an orderer, such as joining a channel, listing the channels an orderer has joined, and removing a channel. The channel participation API must be enabled and the Admin endpoint must be configured in the *orderer.yaml* for each orderer.
====

====
참고: osnadmin channel join
Join an Ordering Service Node (OSN) to a channel. If the channel does not yet exist, it will be created. +
join 시 채널이 존재하지 않으면 생성 후, 참여한다.
====

```
cd "$FABRIC_NETWORK_HOME"

osnadmin channel join --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME} --config-block ./channel-artifacts/${CHANNEL_NAME}.block -o localhost:7071 --ca-file "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/orderer1.moss.com/tlsca/tlsca.orderer1.moss.com-cert.pem" --client-cert "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/orderer1.moss.com/orderers/osn1.orderer1.moss.com/tls/server.crt" --client-key "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/orderer1.moss.com/orderers/osn1.orderer1.moss.com/tls/server.key"

osnadmin channel join --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME} --config-block ./channel-artifacts/${CHANNEL_NAME}.block -o localhost:7072 --ca-file "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/orderer1.moss.com/tlsca/tlsca.orderer1.moss.com-cert.pem" --client-cert "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/orderer1.moss.com/orderers/osn2.orderer1.moss.com/tls/server.crt" --client-key "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/orderer1.moss.com/orderers/osn2.orderer1.moss.com/tls/server.key"

osnadmin channel join --channelID ${CHANNEL_NAME} --config-block ./channel-artifacts/${CHANNEL_NAME}.block -o localhost:7073 --ca-file "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/orderer1.moss.com/tlsca/tlsca.orderer1.moss.com-cert.pem" --client-cert "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/orderer1.moss.com/orderers/osn3.orderer1.moss.com/tls/server.crt" --client-key "${PWD}/organizations/ordererOrganizations/orderer1.moss.com/orderers/osn3.orderer1.moss.com/tls/server.key"

```

채널 생성 로그
```

        "height": 1
}
```

### peer를 채널에 join

'peer channel'를 이용하여 peer들을 채널에 join 시킵니다.

환경변수를 각 peer 맞게 설정 후 'peerchannel join' 명령어를 수행합니다.

* CORE_PEER_ADDRESS
* CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID
* CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH
* CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE

peer의 환경변수 설정을 위해서 script/setPeer.sh 를 사용합니다. (test-network의 script/setGlobals를 참조하여 작성되었습니다.)

script/setPeer.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
